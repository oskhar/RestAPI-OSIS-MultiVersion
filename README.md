# RestAPI-OSIS-MultipleVersion

## Introduction

Welcome to the **RestAPI-OSIS-MultipleVersion** repository! This project demonstrates the implementation of a REST API for the OSIS (Organisasi Siswa Intra Sekolah) system using various technologies. The aim is to showcase different approaches and best practices for building scalable and maintainable REST APIs. This repository includes multiple implementations, each in a separate directory corresponding to a specific technology stack.

## Technology Stacks

We have implemented the REST API using the following technology stacks:

- **Laravel Domain-Driven Design Version**: A DDD approach with Laravel, focusing on domain logic and separation of concerns.
- **Express.js Version**: A lightweight and flexible implementation using Express.js, a popular Node.js framework.
- **Golang Version**: An implementation using Go, known for its efficiency and concurrency features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Git**: Version control system
- **Node.js**: For JavaScript-based implementations
- **PHP & Composer**: For Laravel implementations
- **Go**: For Golang implementation
- **Docker** (optional): For containerized setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RestAPI-OSIS-MultipleVersion.git
   cd RestAPI-OSIS-MultipleVersion
   ```

2. **Navigate to the desired version's directory:**

   ```sh
   cd <version-directory>
   ```

3. **Follow the README in each directory for specific setup instructions.**
